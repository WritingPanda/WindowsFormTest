## Reading and Writing Files in Windows Forms

This is my first attempt at reading and writing to a simple text file with C# and Windows Forms.

Also, the .NET framework is nothing such of extraordinary. I am very excited to continue learning C#.

This repository will store code that I am experimenting with to further learn what Windows Forms are capable of.

However, this will not be a real project. If you would like to see my other projects, please check out the rest of my Github page.

Thank you!
